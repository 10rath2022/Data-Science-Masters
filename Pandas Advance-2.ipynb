These functions are very useful when we need to perform some kind of operation on a specific \"window\" or subset of data, which is defined within a certain span of items in the data set.\n",

    "1. **Rolling Window Functions**: These functions operate on a fixed-size window of data represented by a certain number of periods. The `rolling()` function is used to create a Rolling object, on which we can call various functions to compute rolling statistics. For example, `df.rolling(window=3).mean()` would compute a 3-period rolling mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expanding Window Functions**: These functions operate on an expanding window of data represented by all previous data points. The `expanding()` function is used to create an Expanding object, on which we can call various functions to compute expanding statistics. For example, `df.expanding(min_periods=1).sum()` would compute an expanding sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exponential Weighted Window Functions**: These functions apply more weight to recent items and less weight to items further in the past, making them very useful for time-series data. The `ewm()` function is used to create an Exponential Weighted object, on which we can call various functions to compute exponentially weighted statistics. For example, `df.ewm(span=20).mean()` would compute an exponentially weighted moving average with a span of 20 periods.\n",
